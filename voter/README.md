# Voter Model

## Summary

This Voter model is an implementation of the voting agents described in [*Phase transition and power-law coarsening in an Ising-doped voter model*](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.032145) by Adam Lipowski, Dorota Lipowska, and Ant√≥nio Luis Ferreira.

In its 2-D version presented here, the model is composed of agents placed on a square lattice, having either a positive or negative opinion. In each simulation step, agents decide to change their opinion looking at the opinions of their nearest neighbors based on:

1) a **majority** mechanism, in which agents randonly decide to take up the majority opinion of their neighbors
2) a **persuasion** mechanism, in which agents randomly adopt the opinion of one of their neighbors

## How to run

To launch the model install the requirements first:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then run:
```
python voter/run.py
```
